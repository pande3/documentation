This action extends an entity in the current context with new properties. 

## `Typical Use Cases`

- After creating a contextual entity with any of the load entity actions, use this action to add a property such as an ID before passing to the [Execute actions on entity list ](/actions/execute-actions-on-entity-list.md) action.

## `Don't use it to`

- Create an entity. Use [Create Entity](/actions/create-entity.md) or any of the `Load Entities (Source)` actions instead (e.g. [Load Entities (CSV File)](/actions/load-entities-csv-file.md)).
