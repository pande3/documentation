The central documentation portal provides a structured and searchable collection of information of all aspects of Plant an App, from installation and upgrades to actions and entities, to integrations with a wide range of third- party services e.g., Slack, Authorise.NET, Google, etc.

The Plant an App platform also includes extensive documentation within the development interface itself. Exploring the different actions and options available within a test environment is often the best way to discover what is available.

The [DNN Sharp legacy documentation portal](https://docs.dnnsharp.com/) can also be viable source of information. Note however that this documentation is not maintained by our team. As such, many of the options and procedures have evolved since the move to Plant an App.
