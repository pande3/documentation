This action will allow you to manually trigger a close popup action for the specified module(Action Form/TabsPro).

Using this Action you can edit the following fields:

- **Description**. A short description for the action. Only admins will be able to see this field.
- **Error Message**. An error message that will be displayed in case if a error occurs in this action.
- **Condition**. This boolean expression is used to determine if this action will execute. Use it to enable or disable actions programatically. For example, you’d enable a **ShowError** action only if you’ve found an error let’s say when you parsed a response from a web service. A common example is **[SomeField] == “Some Value”**. This field supports  **Tokens**.
- **Select Module**. Select the module for which you want to trigger a close popup action (Form or TabsPro based on the action selected: Close Action Form Popup, Close TabsPro Popup).
