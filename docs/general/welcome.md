## The Plant an App Documentation Portal

Here you will find guides, information and details about how to use and configure Plant an App and make your low-code app building easy and enjoyable.

To help you navigate and easily find the information you need, the documentation sections mimic the `Configuration` menu design from your Plant an App instance - you will find them to the left of the screen.

Our product evolves constantly and so does our documentation. As we strive to provide you with the most detailed guides and relevant information for your Plant an App journey, you will notice that our Documentation structure and content changes from one version to the next in order to better reflect the platform's changes and improvements.

When you access the portal, you will always be presented with the documentation corresponding to the latest release of Plant an App: "`Current`".

To check the documentation for an older release, please select the desired version from the drop-down list located in the upper part of the screen.

Only the last five versions of the product documentation are kept available for selection in the drop-down list. If you need documentation for an older product version, please <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/important-notes/orientation-guide#getting-help" target="_blank">**contact us**</a>.

For an overview of what has been introduced, improved and fixed in each version, check the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/category/release-notes" target="_blank">`Release Notes`</a> section.

To find specific information, searching by keywords is possible through the Search box.
