## What's new?

### Guides / InfoBox

Our Guides module has had a major overhaul. 

- **Requirements**: The Guide module now requires [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to display guide messages. If Bootstrap 5 is not present, it will load it automatically. 
- **Using Tokens**: With this latest release, it is now possible to use tokens in guides. This allows for more dynamic and personalized messaging.
- **System Guides**: This release also includes the addition of System Guides to the product. The first system guide being released with version 1.25 is a guide for new users. This guide helps new Plant an App users create and use their first entity. In the future, more system guides will be added to cover new release features.

### PDF Extract Action

Already introduced in 1.24 as hotfix, it enables users to extract pages or sections from an existing PDF. When used in conjunction with the merge PDF or generate PDF function, this feature facilitates the creation of fresh PDF files that incorporate both new and pre-existing content.

## Improvements and New Features

### Listings improvements

- The conditions for Grid Buttons now re-evaluate when the listing content refreshes.
- An "auto-switch" feature has been implemented in [BS5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) that automatically changes the view based on the size of the browser window.

### Validation in Actions for `APIâ€™s` and `Automation`

The recently introduced action stack in APIs and Automation now includes additional mandatory validation measures. The following validations are now performed:

- Combined validation (for instance, either value or checkbox in the <a href="https://learn.plantanapp.com/docs/current/actions/send-email" target="_blank">`Send Email`</a> action)
- All Actions now undergo mandatory field validation; these validation checks can help Low-code engineers to avoid overlooking required parameters.

### UI improvements on `API's` and `Automation`

The IntelliSense and autocomplete features have undergone minor UX enhancements:
- List spacing has been improved.
- Parentheses have been cleaned up.
- Autocomplete has been streamlined.
- Several small changes have been implemented to enhance usability.
- Moving to another page or leaving unsaved changes triggers a warning message notifying the user about unsaved changes.
- The keyboard shortcut "`Ctrl` + `S`" can now be used to save changes.

### General improvements

- For narrow screens, the Entity view now includes a horizontal scroll bar.
- The "Run Now" behavior in Jobs has been enhanced.
- The creation of new APIs now prevents duplicate names.
- The Bootstrap 3 Forms templates have been renamed.
- The previous update screen has been removed.
- A shortcut has been added to open the workflow definition in a new browser tab directly from the "`Execute workflow`" option.

### Version control

A version control / MEO version is also available for the 1.25 release.


## Breaking Changes

- XSL templates in Searchboost no longer work, please replace the input and output templates before upgrading to version 1.25.
- Whitespace and dash characters in APIs no longer work.
- Infobox/Guides have had a major upgrade and now need a BS5 skin and can no longer be used with BS3 skins.
- The `PlantAnApp` skin is being phased out. On existing pages that use the PlantAnApp skin, it will be replaced with the Pagebuilder "`default`"  skin variant (BS3). For login pages that use this skin, the "login no menu" skin variant will be used. In a future release, the complete package reference will be removed.
